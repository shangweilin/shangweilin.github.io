### Research Interest

Dr. LINâ€™s research interests can be classified into two main categories: 
* *<u>theoretical</u>* computer science, and
* *<u>practical</u>* computer and software engineering

In the theoretical part, he focuses on formal methods including model checking and theorem proving. Currently, he is working on automatic compositional verification techniques to alleviate the state explosion problem with respect to model checking. He is also interested in applying formal methods on program verification and synthesis.

In the practical part, he focuses on embedded system design, multi-core embedded software development, and application framework design on cyber physical systems. He is also interested in applying formal methods on embedded system verification and synthesis.
